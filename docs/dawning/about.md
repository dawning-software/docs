## Origin
In 2022, **Dawning** was coined as the company & brand to support the research, core technologies, and products created by Dawn Larsson. In October 2024, it was officially registered in Sweden as a for-profit private company.

The cornerstone philosophy driving Dawning is exceptional user experience - so fundamental it touches every aspect of how software is designed and programmed. The software Dawning develops is inherently novel and experimental, spanning realtime experiences or entertainment, developer tools, libraries, and utilities that challenge conventional thinking.

## Dawn-ing
Dawn Larsson, born in Helsingborg, Sweden in 1999, is a lifelong technology enthusiast and creative professional. Dawn has an exceptionally broad skill set encompassing software engineering, systems programming, design, and game & engine development. Self-taught from age 9, Dawn brings a unique perspective unconstrained by traditional education paradigms. 

Active in Open Source since 2018, Dawn has contributed software \& design at Amethyst Game Engine, designed the brand & logo for Tauri Apps and its startup venture.

## Before you do business with Dawning.
Dawning isn't about building a unicorn. It's about building better tools, maintaining complete control, and challenging how we think about software. It's important to understand the driving forces behind the for-profit business strategy, as part of the Company to Customer dynamic you opt into.

#### **Private \& Not For Sale, for Ethical profitability**
To deliver real earned trust with you as a customer, Dawning will remain privately owned by Dawn. This shields the value provided from temporary market conditions, investor-driven "infinitely sustained growth", or other kinds of 3rd party influence.

The private ownership isn't about greed - it's about preventing the inevitable enshittification that comes with external pressures.

#### **Pro-Consumer**
Building what users need, providing software that lasts, software you own, and supporting movements like right to repair.

#### **Maintain creative freedom and independence**
Innovation requires freedom to pursue ideas that seem unintuitive, questionable, or outright stupid.
