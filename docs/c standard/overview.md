# Dawning C Standard Library
<tag>RnD</tag>
</section>

The Dawning C Standard library is a effort to develop a new entirely self contained standard library,
It's also trying to lay the ground work for less error prone DX and type semantics in C.

Traditional type systems and APIs prioritize implementation details over clear expression of intent.

The Type system is explicit about ranges, memory layouts, and semantic meaning. 

Types like `positive`, `bipolar`, and `decimal` **communicate intention**, not just implementation.
The improved clarity aims to make systems programming **safer AND faster** by having **lower cognative load** on the programmer. 


By carefully re-designing the API and type expression, code can become more effective to think, write and audit.
